## Critical Security Vulnerability Fixed

**Date:** December 3, 2025  
**CVE:** CVE-2025-55182  
**Severity:** CVSS 10.0 (Critical)  
**Vulnerability Type:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)

## Overview

A critical security vulnerability was discovered in React Server Components that allows unauthenticated remote code execution by exploiting a flaw in how React decodes payloads sent to React Server Function endpoints.

**Reference:** [React Security Advisory](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components)

## Affected Versions

The vulnerability was present in:
- React Server Components packages: `react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, `react-server-dom-turbopack`
- Versions: 19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0

## Action Taken

### Updated Packages

✅ **Next.js:** Upgraded from `15.5.6` → `15.5.7` (patched version for 15.5.x release line)  
✅ **React:** Upgraded from `18.3.1` → `19.0.1` (patched version)  
✅ **React-DOM:** Upgraded from `18.3.1` → `19.0.1` (patched version)  
✅ **@types/react:** Upgraded from `^18` → `^19`  
✅ **@types/react-dom:** Upgraded from `^18` → `^19`  
✅ **eslint-config-next:** Upgraded from `^15.5.6` → `^15.5.7`

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

All packages have been successfully updated and verified.

## Verification

✅ Type checking passes: `npm run type-check`  
✅ No vulnerabilities found: `npm audit`  
✅ Build successful: `npm run build`

## Notes

- **Peer Dependency Warnings:** Expected when upgrading from React 18 to 19. Some packages (like Radix UI) haven't updated their peer dependencies yet, but React 19 is backward compatible, so these packages continue to work.

- **Next.js Version:** We upgraded to `15.5.7` (not `15.3.6`) because:
  - We were already on the `15.5.x` release line (`15.5.6`)
  - According to the security advisory, `15.5.7` is the patched version for `15.5.x`
  - It's better to stay on the same minor version line rather than downgrading

## Additional Security Measures

1. **Vercel Mitigations:** Vercel has applied temporary mitigations and blocked new deployments of vulnerable Next.js versions
2. **Public Exploits:** Public exploits are now available, making immediate upgrade critical
3. **Threat Activity:** Threat activity has significantly increased since initial disclosure

## Timeline

- **November 29th:** Vulnerability reported by Lachlan Davidson
- **November 30th:** Confirmed by Meta security researchers
- **December 1st:** Fix created and validated
- **December 3rd:** Fix published and publicly disclosed
